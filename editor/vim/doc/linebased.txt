INTRODUCTION                                    *linebased*

This plugin provides filetype detection and syntax highlighting for linebased
files (*.linebased). In Neovim, it also provides LSP integration with lblsp
for go-to-definition, hover, and other language features.

Linebased is a line-oriented configuration format where each expression has
a command name and body. Template definitions use `define`, file inclusion
uses `include`, and template bodies are indented with tabs. For more
information visit https://blake.io/linebased

INSTALLATION                                    *linebased-install*

Clone the repository and add the plugin to your runtimepath. In your vimrc:
>
    set rtp+=~/src/linebased/editor/vim
<
Or in Neovim's init.lua:
>
    vim.opt.rtp:prepend(vim.fn.expand("~/src/linebased/editor/vim"))
<
The plugin will prompt to install the lblsp language server on first use if
it is not found in your PATH. This requires Go to be installed.

To install lblsp manually:
>
    go install blake.io/linebased/cmd/lblsp@latest
<
MAPPINGS                                        *linebased-mappings*

The following |<Plug>| mappings are provided (Neovim only):

                                        *<Plug>(linebased-definition)*
<Plug>(linebased-definition)    Go to definition. Jump to where the template
                                under the cursor is defined.

                                        *<Plug>(linebased-type-definition)*
<Plug>(linebased-type-definition)
                                Go to type definition.

                                        *<Plug>(linebased-hover)*
<Plug>(linebased-hover)         Hover. Show documentation for the template
                                under the cursor.

                                        *<Plug>(linebased-references)*
<Plug>(linebased-references)    Find all references to the template under the
                                cursor.

                                        *<Plug>(linebased-inline)*
<Plug>(linebased-inline)        Inline template. Replace the template call
                                under the cursor with its expanded content.

Default key mappings are created unless |g:linebased_no_mappings| is set or
a mapping to the <Plug> already exists:

        gd      <Plug>(linebased-definition)
        gD      <Plug>(linebased-type-definition)
        K       <Plug>(linebased-hover)
        gri     <Plug>(linebased-inline)

To use different keys, map them in ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/linebased.vim:
>
    nmap <buffer> <Leader>d <Plug>(linebased-definition)
    nmap <buffer> <Leader>r <Plug>(linebased-references)
<
OPTIONS                                         *linebased-options*

                                                *g:loaded_linebased*
g:loaded_linebased      Set to 1 to disable the plugin entirely.

                                                *g:linebased_no_mappings*
g:linebased_no_mappings
                        Set to 1 to disable all default key mappings.
                        The |<Plug>| mappings remain available for you to
                        map manually.

HIGHLIGHTING                                    *linebased-highlighting*

The following highlight groups are defined:

linebasedComment        Comments (lines starting with #)
linebasedDefine         The `define` keyword
linebasedInclude        The `include` keyword
linebasedTemplateName   Template names in define statements
linebasedParameter      Parameters in define statements
linebasedVariable       Variable expansions ($var, ${var})
linebasedCommand        Command names
linebasedContinuation   Body lines (tab-indented)

The LSP provides semantic tokens that may override these groups for more
context-aware highlighting in template bodies.

                                                *linebased-special*
Note: Some colorschemes set Special (used for variables) to the same color
as Normal. If variable expansions are invisible, add to your vimrc:
>
    hi Special guifg=#a3be8c ctermfg=green
<
Or in ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/linebased.vim:
>
    hi Special guifg=#a3be8c ctermfg=green
<
                                                *linebased-markdown*
To enable syntax highlighting in markdown fenced code blocks, add
"linebased" to |g:markdown_fenced_languages| in your vimrc:
>
    let g:markdown_fenced_languages = ['go', 'linebased']
<
ABOUT                                           *linebased-about*
