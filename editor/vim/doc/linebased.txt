INTRODUCTION                                    *linebased*

This plugin provides filetype detection and syntax highlighting for linebased
files (*.linebased). In Neovim, it also provides LSP integration with lblsp
for go-to-definition, hover, and other language features.

Linebased is a line-oriented configuration format where each expression has
a command name and body. Template definitions use `define`, file inclusion
uses `include`, and template bodies are indented with tabs. For more
information visit https://blake.io/linebased

INSTALLATION                                    *linebased-install*

The plugin will prompt to install the lblsp language server on first use if
it is not found in your PATH. This requires Go to be installed.

To install lblsp manually:
>
    go install blake.io/linebased/cmd/lblsp@latest
<
MAPPINGS                                        *linebased-mappings*

These mappings are defined buffer-local in Neovim only:

                                                *linebased-gd*
gd                      Go to definition. Jump to where the template under
                        the cursor is defined.

                                                *linebased-gD*
gD                      Go to type definition.

                                                *linebased-K*
K                       Hover. Show documentation for the template under
                        the cursor.

For other LSP features like find references, add your own mappings:
>
    autocmd FileType linebased nnoremap <buffer> gr :lua vim.lsp.buf.references()<CR>
<

OPTIONS                                         *linebased-options*

                                                *g:loaded_linebased*
g:loaded_linebased      Set to 1 to disable the plugin entirely.

HIGHLIGHTING                                    *linebased-highlighting*

The following highlight groups are defined:

linebasedComment        Comments (lines starting with #)
linebasedDefine         The `define` keyword
linebasedInclude        The `include` keyword
linebasedTemplateName   Template names in define statements
linebasedParameter      Parameters in define statements
linebasedVariable       Variable expansions ($var, ${var})
linebasedCommand        Command names
linebasedContinuation   Body lines (tab-indented)

The LSP provides semantic tokens that may override these groups for more
context-aware highlighting in template bodies.

                                                *linebased-special*
Note: Some colorschemes set Special (used for variables) to the same color
as Normal. If variable expansions are invisible, override it in your vimrc:
>
    hi Special guifg=#a3be8c ctermfg=green
<
Or for linebased files only:
>
    autocmd FileType linebased hi Special guifg=#a3be8c ctermfg=green
<
